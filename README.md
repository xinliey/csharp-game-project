## Overview
An independent Unity game developed in C#, successfully published and released.
This project demonstrates software engineering skills including system design,
gameplay programming, debugging, optimization, and full project ownership.

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- Git / GitHub


## Key Systems & Features
- Pixel 2D
- Modular gameplay architecture
- Player control and input handling
- NPC AI logic (state-based behavior)
- Save / Load system
- UI system separated from core game logic

## Engineering Highlights
- Designed systems with maintainability and extensibility in mind
